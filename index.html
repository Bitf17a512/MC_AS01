	<div>
		<p><b>Git Commit command:</b> I then implemented Git Commit command which is used to save your changes to the local repository. Using the "git commit" command only saves a new commit object in the local Git repository. But since it was my first commit, I had to verify my account details again, which is shown in the image below where i gave my username and email again to verify, after that I implemented git commit again and the changes were saved to my local repository and then I implemented commit command again and "First Commit" named commit was committed i.e saved to the local repository.</p>

	<div>
		<p><b>Git Status command:</b> I then implemented Git Status command which displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. It lets you see which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. Status output does not show you any information regarding the committed project history.</p>
